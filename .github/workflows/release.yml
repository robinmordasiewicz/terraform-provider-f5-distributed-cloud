# This GitHub action can publish assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently it uses HashiCorp's official release workflow for community providers.
#
# To manually trigger this workflow:
#   1. Create a new tag: git tag v1.0.0
#   2. Push the tag: git push origin v1.0.0
#
# Or you can create a release through GitHub UI which will trigger this workflow.
