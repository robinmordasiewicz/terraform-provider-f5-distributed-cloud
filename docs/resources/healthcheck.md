  The f5distributedcloud_healthcheck resource manages Health Checks in F5 Distributed Cloud.
  Health Checks define how origin servers are monitored to determine their health status.
  They can be referenced by origin pools to enable automatic traffic routing away from unhealthy servers.
  Example Usage
  HTTP Health Check

# f5distributedcloud_healthcheck (Resource)

The `f5distributedcloud_healthcheck` resource manages Health Checks in F5 Distributed Cloud.

Health Checks define how origin servers are monitored to determine their health status.
They can be referenced by origin pools to enable automatic traffic routing away from unhealthy servers.

## Example Usage

### HTTP Health Check

```hcl
resource "f5distributedcloud_healthcheck" "http" {
  name        = "my-http-healthcheck"
  namespace   = "my-namespace"
  description = "HTTP health check"

  http_health_check {
    path      = "/health"
    use_https = false
  }

  timeout             = 3
  interval            = 15
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  healthy_threshold   = 2
}
```

### TCP Health Check

```hcl
resource "f5distributedcloud_healthcheck" "tcp" {
  name        = "my-tcp-healthcheck"
  namespace   = "my-namespace"
  description = "TCP health check"

  tcp_health_check {}

  timeout             = 3
  interval            = 15
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  healthy_threshold   = 2
}
```

## Import

Health Checks can be imported using namespace/name:

```shell
terraform import f5distributedcloud_healthcheck.example my-namespace/my-healthcheck
```
